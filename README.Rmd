# IPEDS Pipeline Example

This package demonstrates how to use the `targets` package to build a data 
pipeline in R. This example uses [IPEDS data from the US Department of Education](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?year=2020&surveyNumber=-1&gotoReportId=7&). 

## To Run

Download the repository and run `targets::tar_make()` in the working directory.

To view the pipeline you can run `targets::tar_visnetwork()`. 

```{r visnetwork}
targets::tar_visnetwork()
```
